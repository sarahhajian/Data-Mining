# Data-Mining
This repository is the implementation of data mining algorithms which are done by me(Sarah Hajian) and Fateme HajiAbbasi for the Data Mining Class At Alzahra University.
The folder KNN is the implementation of knn algorithm from scratch.
The folder Naive Bayes is the implementation of Naive Bayes algorithm from scratch.
the folder DM algorithms sklearn is the implementation of Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Knn with sci-kit learn module and Evaluate these algorithms with different methods.
data.csv is the dataset that we use for testing all these implementations.
