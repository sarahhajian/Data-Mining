# Data-Mining
This repository is the implementation of data mining algorithms which are done by me(Sarah Hajian) and Fateme Haji abbasi for the Data Mining Class In Alzahra University.
The folder KNN is the implemetation of knn algorithm from the scratch.
The folder Naive Bayes is the implemetation of Naive Bayes algorithm from the scratch.
the folder DM algorithms sklearn is implementation of Descision Tree, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Knn with scikit learn module and Eveluate these algorithms with diiferent methods.
data.csv is the dataset that we use for testing all these implementations.
